\section{Discussions}

Several results of this mini-project were particularly interesting.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The first one is on Figure~\ref{fig::neural_data_pca1_scatter_classes}, where it can be seen that the walking and resting behavioral categories of \textit{Drosophila} cluster quite nicely when a PCA is performed on the neural activity of the DNs, which means that DNs neural activity can at least partially predict for these behaviors.

Another interesting result is the fact that the logistic regression leads to a better accuracy when classifying for one categorical behavior than for all behaviors simultaneously.
Also worthy of note is that on Figures~\ref{fig::ow_neuron_32},~\ref{fig::ow_neuron_38},~\ref{fig::fr_neuron_93} and~\ref{fig::rf_neuron_62}, we only tried to classify for the walking and resting behaviors.
This is in part motivated by the fact that walking and resting behaviors account for approximately 80 to 90\% of the fly's behavior; and in part because since the beginning of the project, walking and resting behaviors stand out better and are better clustered for, classified or otherwise predicted.
