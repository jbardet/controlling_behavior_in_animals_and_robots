	abstract = {The transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion was a key development in vertebrate evolution. We present a spinal cord model and its implementation in an amphibious salamander robot that demonstrates how a primitive neural circuit for swimming can be extended by phylogenetically more recent limb oscillatory centers to explain the ability of salamanders to switch between swimming and walking. The model suggests neural mechanisms for modulation of velocity, direction, and type of gait that are relevant for all tetrapods. It predicts that limb oscillatory centers have lower intrinsic frequencies than body oscillatory centers, and we present biological data supporting this.},

	abstract = {Animal behavior emerges from a seamless interaction between neural network dynamics, musculoskeletal properties, and the environment. Accessing and understanding the interplay between these intertwined elements requires the development of integrative neuromechanical simulations. Until now, there has been no such simulation framework for the widely studied model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present NeuroMechFly, a data-driven computational model of the adult female fly that is designed to synthesize rapidly growing experimental datasets and to test theories of neuromechanical behavioral control. NeuroMechFly combines a set of modules including an exoskeleton with articulating body parts{\textemdash}limbs, halteres, wings, abdominal segments, head, proboscis, and antennae{\textemdash}muscle models, and neural networks within a physics-based simulation environment. Using this computational framework, we (i) predict the minimal limb degrees-of-freedom needed to replay real Drosophila walking and grooming, (ii) estimate expected contact reaction forces, torques, and tactile signals during these replayed behaviors, and (iii) discover neural network and muscle parameters that enable locomotion using gaits with a variety of speeds and stabilities. Thus, NeuroMechFly is a powerful testbed for building an understanding of how behaviors emerge from interactions between complex neuromechanical systems and their physical surroundings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {In many areas of animal behaviour research, improvements in our ability to collect large and detailed data sets are outstripping our ability to analyse them. These diverse, complex and often high-dimensional data sets exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start by describing the rationale behind ML and review a number of animal behaviour studies where ML has been successfully deployed. The ML framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key ML approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and ecological questions ML can address. The first uses a large number of spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits from PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that ML will play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical toolkit.}
